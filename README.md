Description:

eswacch is a web application that helps people find places to recycle their electronic waste in India. It uses the MERN stack and Mapbox to provide a user-friendly experience. The application has the following features:

Map of e-waste recycling locations with real-time data: The application uses Mapbox to display a map of all known e-waste recycling locations in India, with real-time data on their opening hours and availability. Users can zoom in and out of the map, and click on markers to learn more about each recycling location.

Scheduler with notifications: The application has a scheduler that allows users to schedule appointments at e-waste recycling centers, with notifications to remind them of their upcoming appointments. This is helpful for ensuring that users have a place to recycle their e-waste during the center's open hours and to avoid any inconvenience.

Search function with advanced filters: The application has a search function that allows users to filter recycling locations by type of e-waste, location, and other criteria, such as opening hours, availability of parking, and accessibility for disabled people. This is helpful for users who are looking for a specific type of recycling center, or who need to find a center that is close to them and meets their specific needs.

User dashboard with recycling history and progress tracking: The application has a user dashboard that allows users to manage their appointments, view their recycling history, and track their progress towards their recycling goals. This is helpful for users who need to keep track of their recycling activities and to stay motivated to recycle more.

The application is currently in beta testing, and we are always working to improve it. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know.
We are also working on adding new features to the application, such as the ability to book appointments for specific types of e-waste and the ability to receive alerts when new e-waste recycling locations are added to the map.
We believe that eswacch can play an important role in helping to reduce the amount of e-waste that ends up in landfills in India. By making it easier for people to recycle their e-waste, we can help to protect the environment and conserve resources.
